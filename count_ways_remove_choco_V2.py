"""
Problem: Code a function that count the ways of removing chocolate from a box.
Chocolates can be removed 1 at time or 3 at time. [1,3,1] its different from [3,1,1].


Considerations: I have saw people solving this with recursion method, in a simpler way, but i could not get to
the correct answer. This was the way i have found to find the correct answer. With some know values it worked, but
not sure if will work for every entry.
